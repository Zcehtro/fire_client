## Main goal

Most tutorials cover only the Firebase v8 SDK, which is now deprecated. This project is to work out the basics of the project to use code for Firebase v9 SDK.

Similarly, most tutorials only cover the use of Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Web on desktop, but not for Android and iOS. This project is also to work out the basics implementing said functionality.

The final goal is to have the project fully functional on all platforms, installed and working as a Progressive Web App (PWA).
